I began to learn SpriteKit for educational purpose and I created this Endless Runner 2D with the help of my teammates.
It's a simple game inspired from the most famous Dino on Internet.
You are a student that has missed his deliverable and start to run avoiding obstacles.
This game is made during the Christmas period so we've decided to have a Christmas Edition.
So the obstacles are like Christmas Tree, Snowmans and Christmas presents.
You have to collect more paper possible to complete your deliverable.
Every sprite is created by my teammates with Aseprite.
